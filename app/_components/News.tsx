      <p>
        This is the very first update, so let me start it by saying thank you
        for signing up to JRP-Tools!

        There is one very important topic I want to highlight right off the bat.
        This is an experimental app, running on a free database with (lenient)
        data usage restrictions. This means that aside from bugs, the app might
        become slow when under heavy load â€” and worst case scenario, become
        unaccessible until the next cycle if it hits its monthly threshold.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the current point, I'm not expecting heavy database usage (or abuse),
        which is why I launched this app open for everyone. I'll be keeping a
        close eye on any potential bottlenecks, and any major announcements will
        be made here on the dashboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        With all that said, don't hesitate to report any bugs or issues.
