        <p>
          This is the very first update, so let me start by saying thank you for
          checking out JRP Tools!
        </p>

        <p>
          If you've already signed up and is trying out the app, an even bigger
          thank you! I'd like to take this opportunity to add a reminder that
          this is an experimental app subject to changes, or even discontinuity.
          In the chance of the latter, though, a proper announcement will be
          made in advance to give users time to back up their threads. And by
          that I don't mean manually by going full copy + paste, of course, as a
          backup/export feature is at the top of the list of upcoming features.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app's initial features are introduced in the About page, so
          there's not a lot else to be said right now. Please don't hesitate to
          report any bugs or issues you might stumble into. Suggestions and
          contributions are also welcome!
